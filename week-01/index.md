# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

I see the world through the lens of Rationalism. "Rationalism emphasizes reason, logic, and systematic thinking as the primary sources of
knowledge and ethical guidance"(Ed Weber, 2025). Fortunately, computers operate on logic and reason.

## Authorization Principle
Authorization is, at a fundamental level, what a user is permitted to do. Users 
in an any setting should only be permitted to do what is required to perform their
job and nothing more. A student at a college campus should not have the authorization
to change firewall settings, as it is outside of their purview.

## Policy Snippet
Use of Lab Network is limited to authorized users for research purposes within assigned scope. Users must access only resources for which they have explicit permission and must not perform testing, scanning, or data collection beyond approved tasks. Personal data shall be minimized and handled responsibly. Suspected exposure or misuse must be reported immediately to the Help Desk at example@email.com. Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action.

## Reflection
My example policy snippet is fairly bare bones as it is the first one I have created. Now that I reflect on it, my snippet should include a section preventing users from performing illegal activities on the network. Perhaps also something to prohibit attempting to circumvent the firewall.
