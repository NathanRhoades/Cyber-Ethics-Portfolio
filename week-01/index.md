# Ethics & Law Orientation (Week 1)

## My Ethical Lens
"Rationalism emphasizes reason, logic, and systematic thinking as the primary sources of
knowledge and ethical guidance"(Ed Weber, 2025). 
<!-- 3–4 sentences -->
## Authorization Principle
Authorization is, at a fundimental level, is what a user is permitted to do. Users 
in an any setting should only be permitted to do what is required to perform their
job and nothing more. A student at a college campus should not have the authorization
to change firewall settings, as it is outside of their purview.
<!-- 2–3 sentences: one-sentence definition + concrete campus example -->
## Policy Snippet
Use of Lab Network is limited to authorized users for research purposes within assigned scope. Users must access only resources for which they have explicit permission and must not perform testing, scanning, or data collection beyond approved tasks. Personal data shall be minimized and handled responsibly. Suspected exposure or misuse must be reported immediately to the Help Desk at example@email.com. Violations may result in loss of access and disciplinary action.
